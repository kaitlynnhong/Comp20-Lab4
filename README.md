Lab 4 README
1. All aspects of the lab seem to have worked correctly. I checked all my files via the css and html validators and there were no errors or warnings. But I know my code isn't the cleanest (especially all those nested lists,) and I hope to improve the way I think about these assignments. 
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. 
3. I spent approximately 10-12 hours on this assignment.
